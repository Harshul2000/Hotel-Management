This ia a simple hotel management system created using Python. The user has the option to check in , select a type from four rooms, avail different types of room service,view the rooms which are occupied and check out. I have made use of the OOPS concepts of functions and classes  as well the concept of dictionaries. I have also made use of the date data type so that the user can enter the date they checked in and checked out.
